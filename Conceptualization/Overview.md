# Overview
This describes how I intend to solve the problem presented to me, essentially where I will plan and journal my thought process for building this project. 

## Summary
For the sake of nostalgia/emotional attachment, I decided to name the company Pizza Planet (from Pixar's Toy Story). Based on the requirements of the project, I'm thinking it is an interface for building a menu, such that customers would use this to order from inside or on the website.
